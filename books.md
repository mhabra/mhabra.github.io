## Some books I've read and my thoughts about them

I like to read a lot, even though I don't have time to do it as often as I'd like, so here I've compiled some a list of some books I like (or perhaps don't like), and my thoughts about them.

<h3><a href="https://www.moustafa.io/books/Dune">Dune (Frank Herbert, 1965)</a></h3>
<h3><a href="https://www.moustafa.io/books/Parable-of-the-Sower">Parable of the Sower (Octavia Butler, 1993)</a></h3>
