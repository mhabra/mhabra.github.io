## About Me

I'm a senior at UMich studying biophysics and CS on a pre-med track. I'm really interested in how computer science can play a role in medicine, both from a diagnostic standpoint (ML & AI in radiology and that sort of stuff), as well as modelling health data, in order to uncover larger social and economic trends. I also think CS is important from a biophysics standpoint, (like alphafold, although it might be a bit overhyped), and want to explore more applications it may have.
